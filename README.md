# GradeLeaf
GradeLeaf is an Android app that lets students within the CPS district view grades from Follett Aspen.  Aspen unfortunately does not have a public API, so the app uses web scraping with the jsoup library to get the data.  The main goal of this app is to make checking grades faster and more convenient on mobile devices by serving as an alternative to the Aspen website.

## Class color coding

Classes are color coded by grade and shown in an easy-to-read format.

## Assignment categories

Assignments are sorted into categories, which makes it easier to see what might be bringing your grade down.  The Aspen website uses a category system, but displays all assignemnts in one large list.

## Other features
* Allows parents to easily see grades for all children
* Keeps the user signed in and immediately loads grades upon opening the app
* Displays grades from previous terms within the current year
